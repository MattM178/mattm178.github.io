## New Year Thoughts
I am not very into new years resolutions, but I do want to earnesty try to write more, and think I'll try to do so on this blog. I also plan to share more photos I've taken, once I figure out how to do that here. I've been a city planner with the City of Cleveland for over 6 years. It will be 7 in July 2025. I love public service and the work I am doing is interesting and meaningful, but my workplace is very dysfunctional and offers little support to staff and middle managers. Its probably time for a change.

One project I hope to develop more this year is an isochrone application, as I want to continue to advocate for more Transit Oriented Development in Cleveland. Truly an underappreciated opportunity here. I wish city leaders would seriously embrace it.

Happy new year, everyone.
